Idea behind displaying the graph

 1. Get the Critical X values in the graph
 2. Evaluate the critical X values and add them to the proper format
 3. Update the state and render the result

 1. How to find critical x values
  - x = 0 will always be a critical value
  - x = strike prices will always be c.v
  - x = maxStrike * 1.2 will always be critical value

2. We have defined a evaluatePayoffFunc above and use it in all critical points
